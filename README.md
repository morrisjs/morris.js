## Installation
You can download the latest version of Morris.js06 from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pierresh/morris.js/releases/latest).

To install via npm:

```bash
npm install morris.js06
```

## Requirements

- [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) (>= 2.0)
- [Regression.js](https://github.com/Tom-Alexander/regression-js/releases/tag/1.4.0) (1.4.0) for trendline type polynomial, logarithmic, exponential


## Development

Very daring.

Fork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)

Remember that Morris.js is a coffeescript project. Please make your changes in
the `.coffee` files, not in the compiled javascript files in the root directory
of the project.

### Developer quick-start

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org).  I recommend using
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for installing node in
development environments.

With node installed, install [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) using
`npm install -g grunt-cli`, and then the rest of the test/build dependencies
with `npm install` in the morris.js project folder.

Additionally, [bower](http://bower.io/) is required for for retrieving additional test dependencies.
Install it with `npm install -g bower` and then `bower install` in the morris project folder.

Once you're all set up, you can compile, minify and run the tests using `grunt`.
