# Morris.js - pretty time-series line graphs

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js)

Morris.js is the library that powers the graphs on http://howmanyleft.co.uk/.
It's a very simple API for drawing line, bar, area and donut charts.

Cheers!

## Contributors wanted

I'm unfortunately not able to actively support Morris.js any more. I keep an eye
on the issues, but I rarely have the time to fix bugs or review pull requests.

If you're interested in actively contributing to Morris.js, please contact me on
the email address above.

## Requirements

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (>= 1.7 recommended, but it'll probably work with
  older versions)
- [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) (>= 2.0)

## Usage

See [the website](http://morrisjs.github.com/morris.js/).

## Development

Very daring.

Fork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)

Remember that Morris.js is a coffeescript project. Please make your changes in
the `.coffee` files, not in the compiled javascript files in the root directory
of the project.

### Developer quick-start

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org).  I recommend using
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for installing node in
development environments.

With node installed, install [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) using
`npm install -g grunt-cli`, and then the rest of the test/build dependencies
with `npm install` in the morris.js project folder.

Additionally, [bower](http://bower.io/) is required for for retrieving additional test dependencies.  
Install it with `npm install -g bower` and then `bower install` in the morris project folder.

Once you're all set up, you can compile, minify and run the tests using `grunt`.

Note: I'm experimenting with using perceptual diffs to catch rendering
regressions. Due to font rendering differences between platforms, the pdiff
tests currently *only* pass on OS X.
